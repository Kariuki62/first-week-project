    <h2>The greatness</h2>
    <p>
    My name is Kariuki Wanjohi and here comes a journey of how i became great in everything I did
    My eductaional journey has been great and amazing.
    I did both the IG and 8-4-4 system
    <strong> Here comes the interesting bit </strong>
     In the year 2013 I joined JKUAT where,
    I took my ICT course and graduated in the year 2017
     I've worked in companies such as:
       <ul>
         <li>Kenya Airport Authorities,</li>
         <li> Kenya Power and Lighting Company</li>
         <li>ADEC Innovations.</li>
       </ul>
       Why I decided to take a <span class="programming">code-base</span> programming course was so that i can add on my IT knowledge. Here are other reasons:
       <ol>
         <li>Help in improving my home area coffee industry</li>
         <li>Create employment for my fellow youths</li>
         <li>Work hand in hand with research institutions on making Kenya a better place.</li>
       </ol>
